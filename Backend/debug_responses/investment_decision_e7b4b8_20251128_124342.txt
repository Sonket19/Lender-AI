RAW RESPONSE:

{
    "recommendation": "CONDITIONAL",
    "funding_amount_recommended": "$590,000 USD - Matches their request; sufficient for 18 months runway in India to prove pilot-to-paid conversion.",
    "funding_amount_requested": "INR 5 Crores (~$590,000 USD)",
    "rationale": "The opportunity here is not just 'another AI wrapper' but a vertical-specific play in the industrial and healthcare data space. While the general 'Chat with Data' market is becoming crowded with well-funded US competitors like Julius AI ($10M raised) and giants like Microsoft Copilot, Sia's traction with heavyweights like Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, and IDBI Bank suggests they have solved a specific pain point for complex, regulated industries that generalist tools miss. The 'Bosch Mafia' founding team gives them a unique 'right to win' in the manufacturing sector, where data is messy, siloed, and requires deep domain context to interpret correctly.\n\nHowever, the team composition is heavily skewed toward engineering and product, which is a classic seed-stage risk. While Divya, Karthik, and Sumalata have impressive technical pedigrees and domain expertise, they lack a proven commercial co-founder who has scaled enterprise sales. Their revenue projections ($400k to $12M in two years) are naive and typical of first-time founders who underestimate the enterprise sales cycle. This credibility gap in their go-to-market strategy is my primary concern and why we cannot write a blank check without guardrails.\n\nThe business case, however, is compelling at this valuation. Investing $590k for a significant stake (likely 15-20%) in a company with enterprise pilots already live is an asymmetric bet. If they can convert just 3-4 of their current pilots (Mercedes, IDBI, etc.) into full recurring contracts, they will hit $200k-$300k ARR quickly, justifying a 3x valuation markup at Series A. The unit economics of B2B SaaS in India are favorable; with a burn of ~$35k/month, they have a longer runway than US counterparts to find product-market fit. The path to a $50M-$100M exit is visible if they pivot from a general tool to 'The AI Analytics Platform for Manufacturing & Healthcare.'\n\nTherefore, my decision is CONDITIONAL. We proceed, but we tranche the capital to enforce commercial discipline. I am not worried about them building the product; I am worried about them selling it. The first tranche allows them to deliver on current pilots. The second tranche is unlocked only when they prove they can turn those pilots into recurring revenue. This structure protects our downside while giving them the fuel to prove their thesis. If they refuse these terms, we pass, as the execution risk on the sales side is too high without oversight.",
