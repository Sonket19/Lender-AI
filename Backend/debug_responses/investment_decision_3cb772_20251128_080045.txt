RAW RESPONSE:

{
    "recommendation": "CONDITIONAL",
    "funding_amount_recommended": "$600,000 - This amount provides 12-15 months of runway, which is the minimum time needed to convert their current enterprise pilots into long-term recurring revenue contracts.",
    "funding_amount_requested": "INR 5 Crores (~$600,000 USD)",
    "rationale": "The opportunity here is a classic 'wedge' play in a crowded market. While 'Chat with Data' is noisy with incumbents like Microsoft and Tableau, Sia has identified a critical gap: on-premise, privacy-first deployments for regulated industries like healthcare and manufacturing. The incumbents force cloud adoption, which leaves a massive opening for a solution that brings AI to the data where it sits. Their traction is an outlier for this stage—having $98k in booked ARR and pilots with giants like Bosch and Mercedes-Benz proves they are solving a hair-on-fire problem for serious enterprises, not just playing with AI toys.\n\nThe team is the strongest asset here. Divya and Sumalata aren't just generic founders; they are domain experts coming directly out of Bosch's data science unit. They have lived the pain of fragmented enterprise data pipelines for a decade. This 'founder-market fit' is why they were able to secure such high-profile pilots so early. However, my primary concern is the lack of commercial DNA. They are a team of engineers and operators. To scale from $100k to $1M, they need to prove they can sell to strangers, not just their former professional network.\n\nFinancially, this is a highly capital-efficient bet. Entering at a ~$3M-$4M valuation (implied by the $600k ask for ~15-20%) offers excellent upside if they hit their $400k revenue target next year. The risk is that they become a 'services shop' disguised as a product company, doing custom integrations for every client. If they can maintain 70%+ gross margins and avoid the consulting trap, the path to a $50M+ valuation in 3 years is visible. The downside is limited because the burn is low and the talent is high-quality.\n\nMy decision is a CONDITIONAL INVEST. I am willing to back this, but I need to structure the capital to ensure they build a scalable software platform, not a consulting firm. The tranches will be tied to revenue realization—proving that the 'booked' contracts actually turn into cash in the bank—and the hiring of a commercial lead. We are buying the option on them becoming the 'Palantir for Mid-Market,' but we need to keep the leash tight on execution.",
