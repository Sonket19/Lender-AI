RAW RESPONSE:

{
    "recommendation": "CONDITIONAL",
    "funding_amount_recommended": "$600,000 - [Matches the ask to provide 15 months of runway, structured in tranches to mitigate execution risk]",
    "funding_amount_requested": "INR 5 Crores (~$600,000 USD)",
    "rationale": "The opportunity here isn't just another 'AI wrapper'—it's the specific 'On-Premise/Private AI' wedge Sia is driving into the manufacturing and healthcare sectors. While Microsoft and Salesforce dominate the cloud analytics space, there is a massive, underserved market of regulated industries that cannot send sensitive data to public LLMs. Sia's traction with Abha Hospital ($98k contract) and pilots with Mercedes-Benz validates that large enterprises are hungry for a secure, conversational interface that sits inside their firewall. If that $98k contract is real and deployable, it proves a willingness to pay that puts them ahead of 90% of seed-stage AI startups.\n\nThe team is a classic 'engineers solving their own problem' profile. Karthik and Sumalata bring deep domain expertise from Bosch, giving them a genuine understanding of the messy, fragmented data reality in large enterprises. However, the lack of a commercial co-founder is a glaring gap. They are heavy on patents but light on pricing strategy and go-to-market motion. Their projection of jumping from ~$5k realized revenue to $400k in one year is optimistic without a seasoned sales leader. We are betting on their technical brilliance, but we must help them install a sales engine immediately.\n\nFinancially, the entry valuation (~$3M-$4M) is attractive relative to US-based competitors raising at $15M+ caps. Their India-based cost structure means this $600k buys them 15-18 months of runway, whereas a Valley startup would burn it in four. The path to 10x value relies on them dominating the 'Private AI Analytics' niche in India and the Middle East before expanding globally. If they can lock in 10-15 enterprise customers at $50k ACV, they become a highly attractive acquisition target for legacy on-prem vendors or a strong Series A candidate.\n\nMy decision is CONDITIONAL because while the product-market fit signals are strong, the revenue quality is unverified. The discrepancy between 'booked' ($98k) and 'realized' revenue is a risk we need to control. We will proceed, but capital will be released in tranches tied to converting that booked contract into cash and hiring a sales leader. We are not just funding development; we are funding the transition from a project to a business.",
